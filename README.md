During the course of Algorithms of my Master of Science I was asked to prepare a presentation about RSA cryptography.

RSA cryptography encrypts messages sent between two communicating parties so that an eavesdropper who overhears the
it will not be able to decode them. Moreover, it enables a party to append an unforgeable “digital signature” to the end of an electronic message.

Examples of use are:
• web servers and browsers to secure web tracking
• ensure privacy and authenticity of email
• secure remote login sessions
• heart of electronic credit-card payment systems and ID documents (“smart card”)
• where security of digital data is a concern.

In the pdf in the repository there are the slides of my speeach where the functioning of the RSA cryptosystem is explained.
